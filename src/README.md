# Source Projects

This folder conatins the source code for the solution projects.

When adding source projects to the solution in Visual Studio, remember to add `\src` to the end of the location in the New Project dialog!

> Test and example projects should not be added here, and should instead be added to the `test` and `samples` folders respectively.
